My main individual project which I'm working on for about 4 years. It's a game that combines logic, skill and adventure in a world of hostile desolation. The game is still in development, but its first chapter is completed and ready for beta-testing. The game is written in vanilla C++ and DirectX 11 engine.

# Squirrel-Math
![Squirrel-Math](images/Squirrel-Math.png)

An extensive project I'm working on in collaboration with my friend, [Creestoph](https://github.com/Creestoph/). It aims to be an educational platform teaching mathematics, enhanced by interactive software and rich visuals. Primary foundation of the website is to lead an user through the whole  process of math education in a clear, ordered manner, starting from the very basic concepts like natural numbers, and ending on integration, complex analysis or even further. It's written in Polish, but planned to be translated into other languages in the future. I'm responsible for all the contents of website, graphic design and some of the scripts. The website uses Vue.js framework.

A team project from university: Third Person Shooter proof of concept, created in Unity 3D (C#) and Blender. The goal is to survive and defeat as many enemies as possible. The game implements mechanics of environment destruction and allows partial control of resulting debris. I'm responsible for all the modelling, scene design and partially for movement and destruction mechanics.

BSc thesis implementation: desktop application for 4D geometry visualisation. It helps you understand four-dimensional space using projections and intersections of four-dimensional shapes in different orientations and perspective. The application contains a set of predefined 4D shapes, involving [regular polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope), solids of revolution and demo concave geometry, as well as simple 3D shapes for anology. It's written in C++, WinAPI and DirectX 11 engine.
